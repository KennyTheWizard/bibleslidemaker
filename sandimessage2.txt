Self-Forgiveness
Jesus, I forgive myself for all that has happened, all that has gone on, because You say that I must forgive to be forgiven. I make a decision to forgive myself. I ask You, Lord, to forgive me. I take all negative and tormenting thoughts, feelings, and unforgiveness that I carry toward myself, and I put these into my hands. (Cup your hands) All personal hurts, self-bitterness, self-resentment, self-anger, self-rejection, self-deception, self-manipulation, self-hatred, self-loathing (name any others). So here they are Lord, I give them to You. (Lift your hands and give them to Jesus).
In Jesus’ name, I destroy and break, cancel and vacate all judgments I have made and stated against myself. These judgments are now broken, null and void and I am free. Father, please forgive me for pronouncing judgment on myself. I leave judgment to You. I command all evil spirits that have come through these judgments to depart. Demons of these judgments, in the name of Jesus, GO!
In Jesus’ name, I also break the power of all curses I have spoken over myself. I cancel all ungodly vows that I have made. Lord Jesus, I now receive from your hands all the blessings you have for me in exchange for all the curses that have been removed! Thank you, Jesus, that You are now healing every self-inflicted wound that I have sustained. (Close your eyes and see Jesus healing every part of your soul).
