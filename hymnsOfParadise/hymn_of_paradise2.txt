RESPONSE: Blessed is He who was pierced 
and so removed the sword from the entry to 
Paradise.

Blessed is he 
for whom Paradise yearns. 
Yes, Paradise yearns for the man whose goodness 
makes him beautiful; 
it engulfs him at its gateway, 
it embraces him in its bosom, 
it caresses him in its very womb; 
for it splits open and receives him 
into its inmost parts. 
But if there is someone it abhors, 
it removes him and casts him out; 
this is the gate of testing 
that belongs to Him who loves mankind.

Forge here on earth and take 
the key* to Paradise; 
the Door that welcomes you 
smiles radiantly upon you; 
the Door, all discerning, 
conforms its measure to those who enter it: 
in its wisdom 
it shrinks and it grows. 
According to the stature and rank 
attained by each person, 
it shows by its dimensions 
whether they are perfect, or lacking in something.

When people see 
that they have lost everything, 
that riches do not endure 
and carnal desires no longer exist, 
that beauty and power 
disappear and vanish, 
then they recollect themselves 
and are filled with remorse, 
because, choked with care, 
they heard with contempt those words, 
"Your possessions are but a passing dream, 
your inheritance, darkness."*

What they once possessed they have lost, 
and found what they never had; 
they desired happiness, but it flew away, 
and the woe they had dreaded has arrived; 
what they had hoped on has proved an illusion, 
and what they never sought for they have now found. 
They groan because they are brought low 
and have been "robbed," 
for their way of life deceived them, 
while their torment is very real; 
their luxurious living* has vanished, 
and their punishment does not come to an end.

The righteous, too, perceive 
that their own affiiction no longer exists, 
their suffering does not endure,
their burden no longer remains, 
and it seems as if no anguish 
had ever assailed them. 
Their fasts appear 
as though a mere dream, 
for they have woken as it were from sleep 
to discover Paradise 
and the Kingdom's table
spread out before them. 

By those who are outside 
the summit cannot be scaled, 
but from inside Paradise inclines its whole self 
to all who ascend it; 
the whole of its interior 
gazes upon the just with joy. 
Paradise girds the loins 
of the world, 
encircling the great sea; 
neighbor to the beings on high, 
friendly to those within it, 
hostile to those without. 

At its boundary I saw 
figs, growing in a sheltered place,
from which crowns were made that adorned 
the brows of the guilty pair, 
while their leaves blushed, as it were, 
for him who was stripped naked: 
their leaves were required for those two 
who had lost their garments;* 
although they covered Adam, 
still they made him blush with shame and repent, 
because, in a place of such splendor, 
a man who is naked is filled with shame.

Who is capable of gazing 
upon the Garden's splendor, 
seeing how glorious it is in all its design, 
how harmonious in its proportions, 
how spacious for those who dwell there, 
how radiant with its abodes? 
Its fountains delight 
with their fragrance, 
but when they issue forth toward us
they become impoverished in our country, 
since they put on the savors 
of our land as we drink them. 

Indeed, that Will 
for whom everything is easy 
constrains these abundant 
fountains of Paradise, 
confining them with land, 
like water channels; 
He summoned them to issue forth 
in our direction, 
just as He bound up the waters
in the bosom of His clouds, 
ready to be sent forth into the atmosphere 
at the bidding of His Will. 

When He made this intricate design 
He varied its beauties, 
so that some levels 
were far more glorious than others. 
To the degree that one level 
is higher than another, 
so too is its glory 
the more sublime. 
In this way He allots 
the foothills to the most lowly, 
the slopes to those in bet ween 
and the heights to the exalted. 

When the just ascend its various levels 
to receive their inheritance, 
with justice He raises up each one 
to the degree that accords with his labors; 
each is stopped at the level 
whereof he is worthy, 
there being sufficient levels in Paradise 
for everyone: 
the lowest parts for the repentant, 
the middle for the righteous, 
the heights for those victorious, 
while the summit is reserved for God's Presence.

Noah made the animals live 
in the lowest part of the Ark; 
in the middle part 
he lodged the birds,
while Noah himself, like the Deity, 
resided on the upper deck. 
On Mount Sinai it was the people 
who dwelt below, 
the priests round about it, 
and Aaron halfway up, 
while Moses was on its heights, 
and the Glorious One on the summit. 

A symbol of the divisions 
in that Garden of Life 
did Moses trace out in the Ark 
and on Mount Sinai too; 
he depicted for us the types of Paradise 
with all its arrangements: 
harmonious, fair and desirable 
in all things in its height, its beauty, 
its fragrance, and its diflerent species. 
Here is the harbor of all riches, 
whereby the Church is depicted.
