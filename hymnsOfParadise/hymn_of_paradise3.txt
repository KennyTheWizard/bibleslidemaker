Praise to Your Justice that crowns the victorious.

As for that part of the Garden, my beloved, 
which is situated so gloriously 
at the summit of that height 
where dwells the Glory, 
not even its symbol 
can be depicted in man's thought; 
for what mind 
has the sensitivity 
to gaze upon it, 
or the faculties to explore it, 
or the capacity to attain to that Garden 
whose riches arc beyond comprehension. 

Perhaps that blessed tree, 
the Tree of Life, 
is, by its rays, 
the sun of Paradise; 
its leaves glisten, 
and on them are impressed 
the spiritual graces 
of that Garden. 
In the breezes the other trees 
bow down as if in worship 
before that sovereign 
and leader of the trees. 

In the very midst He planted 
the Tree of Knowledge,
endowing it with awe, 
hedging it in with dread, 
so that it might straight way serve 
as a boundary to the inner region of Paradise. 
Two things did Adam hear 
in that single decree: 
that they should not eat of it
and that, by shrinking from it, 
they should perceive that it was not lawful 
to penetrate further, beyond that Tree.

The serpent could not 
enter Paradise, 
for neither animal 
nor bird 
was permitted to approach 
the outer region of Paradise, 
and Adam had to go out 
to meet them; 
so the serpent cunningly learned, 
through questioning Eve, 
the character of Paradise, 
what it was and how it was ordered. 

When the accursed one learned 
how the glory of that inner Tabernacle, 
as if in a sanctuary, 
was hidden from them, 
and that the Tree of Knowledge, 
clothed with an injunction, 
served as the veil 
for the sanctuary, 
he realized that its fruit 
was the key of justice 
that would open the eyes of the bold 
-and cause them great remorse. 

Their eyes were open --
though at the same time they were still closed 
so as not to see the Glory 
or their own low estate, 
so as not to see the Glory 
of that inner Tabernacle, 
nor to see the nakedness 
of their own bodies. 
These two kinds of knowledge 
God hid in the Tree, 
placing it as a judge 
between the two parties. 

But when Adam boldly ran 
and ate of its fruit 
this double knowledge 
straightway flew toward him, 
tore away and removed 
both veils from his eyes: 
he beheld the Glory of the Holy of Holies 
and trembled; 
he beheld, too, his own shame and blushed, 
groaning and lamenting 
because the twofold knowledge he had gained 
had proved for him a torment. 

Whoever has eaten 
of that fruit 
either sees and is filled with delight, 
or he sees and groans out. 
The serpent incited them to eat in sin 
so that they might lament; 
having seen the blessed state, 
they could not taste of it
like that hero of old* 
whose torment was doubled 
because in his hunger he could not taste 
the delights which he beheld. 

For God had not allowed him 
to sec his naked state, 
so that, should he spurn the commandment, 
his ignominy might be shown him. 
Nor did He show him the Holy of Holies, 
in order that, if he kept the command, 
he might set eyes upon it 
and rejoice. 
These two things did God conceal, 
as the two recompenses, 
so that Adam might receive, by means of his contest, 
a crown that befitted his actions. 

God established the Tree as judge, 
so that if Adam should eat from it, 
it might show him that rank 
which he had lost through his pride, 
and show him, as well, that low estate 
he had acquired, to his torment. 
Whereas, if he should overcome and conquer, 
it would robe him in glory 
and reveal to him also 
the nature of shame, 
so that he might acquire, in his good health, 
an understanding of sickness. 

A man, indeed, who has acquired 
good health in himself, 
and is aware in his mind 
of what sickness is, 
has gained something beneficial 
and he knows something profitable; 
but a man who lies 
in sickness, 
and knows in his mind 
what is good health, 
is vexed by his sickness 
and tormented in his mind. 

Had Adam conquered,
he would have acquired 
glory upon his limbs, 
and discernment of what suffering is, 
so that he might be radiant in his limbs 
and grow in his discernment. 
But the serpent reversed all this 
and made him taste 
abasement in reality, 
and glory in recollection only, 
so that he might feel shame at what he had found 
and weep at what he had lost. 

The Tree was to him 
like a gate; 
its fruit was the veil 
covering that hidden Tabernacle. 
Adam snatched the fruit, 
casting aside the commandment. 
When he beheld that Glory 
within, 
shining forth with its rays, 
he fled outside; 
he ran off and took refuge 
among the modest fig trees. 

In the midst of Paradise God had planted 
the Tree of Knowledge 
to separate off, above and below, 
sanctuary from Holy of Holies. 
Adam made bold to touch, 
and was smitten like Uzziah:"'4 
the king became leprous, 
Adam was stripped. 
Being struck like Uzziah, 
he hastened to leave: 
both kingsâ€¢ fled and hid, 
in shame of their bodies. 

Even though all the trees 
of Paradise 
are clothed each in its own glory, 
yet each veils itself at the Glory; 
the Seraphs with their wings, 
the trees with their branches, 
all cover their faces so as not to behold 
their Lord. 
They all blushed at Adam 
who was suddenly found naked; 
the serpent had stolen his garments, 
for which it was deprived of its feet.

God did not permit 
Adam to enter 
that innermost Tabernacle; 
this was withheld, 
so that first he might prove pleasing 
in his service of that outer Tabernacle; 
like a priest 
with fragrant incense, 
Adam's keeping of the commandment 
was to be his censer; 
then he might enter before the Hidden One 
into that hidden Tabernacle.

The symbol of Paradise 
was depicted by Moses 
who made the two sanctuaries, 
the sanctuary and the Holy of Holies; 
into the outer one 
entrance was permitted, 
but into the inner, 
only once a year.
So too with Paradise, 
God closed off the inner part, 
but He opened up the outer, 
wherein Adam might graze.
