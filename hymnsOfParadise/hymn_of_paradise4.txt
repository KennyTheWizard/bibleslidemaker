Deem me worthy that through Your grace we may enter Your Paradise. 

The Just One saw how Adam had become audacious 
because He had been lenient, 
and He knew that he would overstep again 
if He continued thus; 
Adam had trampled down 
that gentle and pleasant boundary, 
so instead God made for him 
a boundary guarded by force. 
The mere words of the commandment 
had been the boundary to the Tree, 
but now the cherub and the sharp sword 
provided the fence to Paradise. 1 

Adam in all his filth 
sought to enter 
that Holy of Holies 
which loves only those who resemble it; 
and because he made bold to enter 
that inner tabernacle, 
God did not allow him to enter 
the outer one either. 
When that sea full of life 
saw a corpse in its midst, 
it did not leave it there 
but cast it forth. 

Moses depicted the type 
among the people of the Hebrews: 
when a man becomes leprous 
within the encampment 
he is driven from its midst 
and cast outside; 
while if he sloughs off his leprosy 
and makes supplication? 
the priest purifies him 
with hyssop, blood and water,3 
and he returns to his former abode 
and enters into his inheritance. 

Adam had been most pure 
in that fair Garden, 
but he became leprous and repulsive 
because the serpent had breathed on him. 
The Garden cast him from its midst; 
all shining, it thrust him forth. 
The High Priest,4 the Exalted One, 
beheld him 
cast out from Himself: 
He stooped down and came to him, 
He cleansed him with hyssop, 
and led him back to Paradise. 

Adam had been naked and fair, 
but his diligent wife 
labored and made for him 
a garment covered with stains. 
The Garden, seeing him thus vile, 
drove him forth. 
Through Mary Adam had 
another robe* 
which adorned the thief;
and when he became resplendent at Christ's 
promise, 
the Garden, looking on, 
embraced him in Adam's place. 

Moses who doubted 
saw but did not enter 
the land of God's promise;
the Jordan served as a boundary. 
Adam went astray and left 
the Garden of Life; 
the cherub became a fence. 
Both boundaries were set 
by the hand of our Lord, 
but at the Resurrection they both entered: 
Moses, into that land, 
and Adam, into Paradise. 

The tongue cannot relate 
the description of innermost Paradise, 
nor indeed docs it sullice 
for the beauties of the outer part; 
for even the simple adornments 
by the Garden's fence 
cannot be related 
in an adequate way. 
For the colors of Paradise are full of joy, 
its scents most wonderful
its beauties most desirable, 
and its delicacies glorious. 

Even though the treasure 
that adjoins the fence is lowly, 
yet it surpasses all other treasures 
in the world entire; 
and by as much as the slopes, too, 
are lowly in comparison 
with that treasury 
of the summit on high, 
so the blessed state by the fence 
is more glorious and exalted 
than all that we experience as blessed, 
who live in the valley below. 

Be not angry that my tongue 
has presumed to describe a theme 
too great for it, 
and so, through its own inadequacy, has 
diminjshed that greatness. 
As there is no mirror adequate 
to reflect its beauty, 
nor paints 
which may portray it, 
then may my attempt not be rejected, 
for I have labored to compose 
in my description of Paradise 
a means whereby we may gain profit. 

The mourner can find comfort therein 
the child be educated thereby, 
the chaste become radiant through it, 
the needy find provision from it. 
And so let each one of them throw me 
his little coin,* 
and may they all make supplication for me 
in Eden, 
so that I may enter that place 
whereof I have spoken in so far as I am able; 
and so that the downcast may become desirous 
of the riches that it promises. 

May my purpose not be judged 
by You, O Knower of all things; 
may my search not be held blameworthy 
by You, concealed from all; 
for I have not made bold to speak 
of Your generation, hidden from all; 
in silence 
I have bounded the Word. 
Yet because I have honored Your birth, 
a11ow me to dwell in Your Paradise. 
From all who love You 
be praise to Your hiddenness!
